SMS Crypto Bot: 
A simple Node.js bot that sends crypto balances, last ticker prices, and a lil’ motivational push to my little Nokia phone since military service means more offline time than I’d like.

I'm currently in military service, and while smartphones aren't allowed, I still want to:

💸 Know my balance

...all via a basic SMS message.
